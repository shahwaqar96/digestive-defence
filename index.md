Digestive Defense features Lactospore® which is a universally occurring beneficial bacteria. It is a gram-positive, spore-forming, lactic acid producing probiotic. Probiotics, such as B. Coagulans (formerly known as Lactobacillus sporogenes), support the growth of friendly bacteria and help maintain a healthy balance of microflora in the intestinal environment.*

The role of lactic acid bacteria in gastrointestinal microecology has been the subject of extensive research. It is widely believed that these bacteria prevent the growth of putrefactive microorganisms by:

Competitive inhibition
Generation of non-conducive acidic environment
Production of antibiotic-like substances (bacteriocins)
 

DIGESTIVE DEFENSE™ FEATURES INCLUDE:
Heat Stability
Digestive Defense does not require refrigeration to maintain its peak potency.

Gastric Acid Resistance:
Digestive Defense probiotic is better adapted to survive gastric acidity due to its spores. The spore coat protects the bacteria from the low pH of the stomach, but also swells in contact with the gastric juices such that by the time the bacteria reaches the intestine, it has shed its spore and germinates in the intestine.*
